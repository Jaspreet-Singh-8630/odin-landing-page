                <h2>Origin of The Odin Project</h2>
                <p>The Odin Project provides a free open source coding curriculum that can be taken entirely online.
                    Since its inception, it has helped many students get hired as developers and has assisted countless
                    others in learning enough programming to work on their own personal projects.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Erik Trautman founded The Odin Project in 2013. Currently it is maintained and continually improved
                    by a team of volunteers many of whom learned to code with us. Many find success from Odin Project's
                    curriculum because of its hands-on approach with learning and emphasis on building projects. The
                    curriculum is meticulously curated to ensure the content is up-to-date.

            <p>TOP was a perfect match for my learning style. Not walking me through an entire project but actually
                forcing me to figure it out on my own, by pointing me in all the right directions in order to complete
                them. That helped me dig deeper into various important topics, which then gave me the necessary
                knowledge and confidence to start applying for jobs and landing that dream job. The community was part
                of it too, first getting help and then helping, it was a great way to learn and make it stick.</p>
